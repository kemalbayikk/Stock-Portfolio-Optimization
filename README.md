# Stock Portfolio Optimization using Genetic Algorithms

In this project, stock portfolio optimization was performed using Genetic Algorithm (GA). 15 stocks were selected from the S&P 500 and a portfolio containing all or some of these stocks was created by using the prices of these stocks between May 5, 2012 and December 31, 2022. The purpose of the GA is to optimize the weight of these stocks in the portfolio by maximizing the sharpe ratio. The portfolio was tested with stock prices between January 1, 2023 and January 1, 2024 and its percentage return was calculated. The results obtained from this experiment provided a return approximately 2.55 times higher than the S&P 500 index, and it can be said that this was a successful result. In addition, optimized portfolios were created with different crossover rate, mutation rate and population size values and the effect of these parameters on the convergence time was observed. According to the result, changing the crossover rate and population size parameters has almost no effect, while reducing the mutation rate increases the convergence time to the optimal solution.
